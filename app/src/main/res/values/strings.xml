    <string name="kc_bio">
        My name is Kassandra Camarillo. I am from San Diego, CA. I am enrolled in the MS
        program in Computer Science at PACE University. I completed a coding bootcamp
        in 2023 where I discovered a love for coding which has led me to pursue the MS program at PACE University
        and ultimately begin a career in computer science.\n\n
        I currently work at a psychiatric hospital in San Diego. In 2020, I completed an AmeriCorps fellowship
        where I worked in a Safe Parking Program which offers support to unsheltered San Diegans living out of their vehicles.
        After completing the AmeriCorps fellowship, I worked at a homeless shleter in downtown San Diego.
        My goal is to use my computer programming skills to help undeserved communities, particularly individuals experiencing homelessness.\n\n
